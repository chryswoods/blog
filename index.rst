There and back again:
=====================
An RSE's Tale
=============

I have spent the last two weeks working to improve trust and 
reproducability of software that is used to inform goverment
policy on the Covid-19 outbreak. The result is
`MetaWards Python <https://metawards.github.io>`__, which 
is a Python port of the original 
`MetaWards C code <https://github.com/ldanon/metawards>`__.

The move from C to Python, and then back again to C via Cython,
has taught me a lot about what it means to be an RSE,
and the vital role of good research software engineering 
and data science during this crisis. Throughout, I've wanted to 
blog to share my experience with other RSEs, but time had got in the way.
What was a short post has now grown into an epic long read, now divided 
into three parts, which are linked to below.

Part 1: Fellowship of the Ring
------------------------------
`Part one of the blog <fellowship>`__ discusses the importance of trust in software,
and how the vital role of RSEs is to improve trust.

Part 2: The Two Towers
----------------------
`Part two <two_towers>`__ discusses how an RSE can climb the 
two towers of making a code fast, while also keeping it correct.

Part 3: Return of the King
--------------------------
Part three (coming later this week). What is it that is returning? ;-)
